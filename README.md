I am brainstorming the idea of developing a data structure similiar to how we store and process data in our brain. My main point is to develop a data structure which uses information linking and pattern matching to generate logical results.

Such as,
```Diff
phone get charged if battery dies. 
+ipad can also get charged if battery dies.
```
```Diff
I eat bread if Im hungry
+I can also eat apple if Im hungry,
```


So, I think information we now and producing research is nothing but linking the information together and catching the similiar "patterns".
```Diff
There is a video-chat app for bussiness people.
+ Why not also do it for gamers.
```


Generally the 'aha' moments and the big ideas came from the people which have knowledge in two different domains. And when they see matching patterns they be like oh my gosh. That would be a great idea!

I ll go with very basic exapmle,

Agricultural Engineer: I can see the disease of the plant by looking to its leaf.

Computer Vision Guy  : I can use computer vision to see the disease of the plant by looking to its leaf.

I know this example is hella lame. but thats all what I can do best right now.

## Where to start?

we should start slow and little. Like a kids brain.
my turing test for now is,

V1 -> I have a new laptop and my battery died. how can I fix it? => use a charger

V2 -> My laptop is not opening how can i fix it => it battery might be died, use a charger

V3 -> My laptops battery dies so fast. How can I fix it? (proceeds to develop a new battery technology.. haha just kidding..! but maybe one day ..? )
